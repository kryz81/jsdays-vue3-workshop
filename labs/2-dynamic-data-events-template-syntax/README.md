#### Dynamic data, events and template syntax

**To do:**
1. Show a list of projects (use HTML "table" tag)
2. Implement 3 actions for every project: add day, remove day, reset progress 
3. Show available budget and the sum of logged days (for sum use "computed")
4. Show a warning only when the number of logged days is larger than budget 
5. For "estimated days" cell in the table set color dynamically (red when estimated days > logged days). Use class binding
