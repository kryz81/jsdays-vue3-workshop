#### Fetching data, component lifecycle

**To do:**
1. We will emulate “backend API” using json-server  
 1.1 In a new window start server: **npm run backend**
2. Remove projects.js file
3. Load projects using service located in the services folder
4. Fetch projects on component creation ("created" hook)
5. Optional  
 6.1 Add “delete project” feature  
 6.2 Add “save new project to server” feature
